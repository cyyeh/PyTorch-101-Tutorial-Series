Welcome to our tutorial on debugging and Visualisation in PyTorch. This is, for atleast now, is the last part of our PyTorch series start from basic understanding of graphs, all the way to this tutorial. In this tutorial we will cover. \n","\n","So let's get started. \n","\n","## Understanding PyTorch Hooks\n","\n","Hooks in PyTorch are severely underdocumented for the functionality they bring to the table. Consider them like the the Doctor Fate of the superheroes. Haven't heard of him? Exactly. That's the point. \n","\n","\n","One of the reason I like hooks so much is that they provide you to do things during backpropagation. A hook is like a one of those devices that many heroes leave behind in the villain's den to get all the inform. You can *register* a hook on a `Tensor` or a `nn.Module`. A hook is basically a function that is executed when the either `forward` or `backward` is called.\n","\n","When I say `forward`, I don't mean the `forward` of a `nn.Module` function where we describe how we will compute the output. `forward` function here means the `forward`function of the `torch.Autograd.Function` object that is the `grad_fn` of a Tensor. Last line seem gibberish to you? I recommend you to please checkout our article on computation graph in PyTorch. If you are just being lazy, then understand every tensor has a `grad_fn` which is the `torch.Autograd.Function` object which created the tensor. For example, if a tensor is created by `tens = tens1 + tens2`, it's `grad_fn` is `AddBackward`. Still doesn't make sense? You should definitely go back and read this article.\n","\n","Notice, that a `nn.Module` like a `nn.Linear` has multiple `forward` invocations. It's output is created by two operations, (Y = W * X + B), addition and multiplication and thus there will be two `forward` calls. This can mess things up, and can lead to multiple outputs. We will touch this in more detail later in this article. \n","\n","PyTorch provides two types of hooks.\n","\n","1. The Forward Hook \n","2. The Backward Hook\n","\n","A forward hook is executed during the forward pass, while the backward hook is , well, you guessed it, executed when the `backward` function is called. Time to remind you again, these are the `forward` and `backward` functions of an `Autograd.Function` object. \n","\n","### Hooks for Tensors\n","\n","\n","A hook is basically a function, with a very specific signature. When we say a hook is executed, in reality, we are talking about this function being executed. \n","\n","For tensors, the signature for backward hook is,  \n","\n","```\n","hook(grad) -> Tensor or None\n","\n","```\n","There is no `forward` hook for a tensor. \n","\n","`grad` is basically the value contained in the `grad` attribute of the tensor **after** `backward` is called. The function is not supposed modify it's argument. It must either return `None` or a Tensor which will be used in place of `grad` for further gradient computation. We provide an example below.

You can print the value of gradient for debugging. You can also log them. This is especially useful with non-leaf variables whose gradients are freed up unless you call `retain_grad` upon them. Doing the latter can lead to increased memory retention. Hooks provide much cleaner way to aggregate these values. \n","\n","2. You can modify gradients **during** the backward pass. This is very important. While you can still access the the `grad` variable of a tensor in a network, you can only access it after the **entire** backward pass has been done. For example, let us consider what we did above. We multplied `b`'s gradient by 2, and now the subsequent gradient calculations, like those of `a` (or any tensor that will depend upon `b` for gradient) use the 2 * grad(b) instead of grad(b). In contrast, had we individually updated the parameters **after** the `backward`, we'd have to multiply `b.grad` as well as `a.grad` (or infact, all tensors that depend on `b` for gradient) by 2.

This is why the `input` to the hook function can be a tuple containing the inputs to two different `forward` calls. `output` s the output of the forward call. \n","\n","`grad_input` is the gradient of the input of `nn.Module` object w.r.t to the loss ( dL / dx, dL / dw, dL / b). `grad_output` is the gradient of the output of the `nn.Module` object w.r.t to the gradient.

Add to that `Conv2d` uses `im2col` or it's cousin to flatten an image such that convolutional over the whole image can be done through matrix computation and not looping.
